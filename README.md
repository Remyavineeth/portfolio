***Portfolio Website***

**Overview**

A portfolio takes the form of a personal website with a collection of
work samples and case studies. It should highlight your skills while
also introducing yourself to your audience --- potential clients, future employers, or just your followers --- both professionally and
personally. It's a space to share what you've accomplished, and, if
you're looking for a new role, what you hope to accomplish next. A great portfolio doesn't only show your work; it tells a story about how you conceptualize and execute solutions to design problems.

 

While online portfolios can be unique and personal, they should always
have a purpose with specific 

goals. This could include any number of the following:

-      You're a new graduate searching for your first role*

-      You're looking to take on freelance work and attract your first
    clients

-      You just want to build a space to document your projects*

-      You want to grow your professional online presence and build a following of your work
